# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: During my bootcamp with General Assembly, we would often be asked to complete a codewars challenge. Most days we were given a coding challenge, I would become frustrated and discouraged and I rarely finished the challenge. I am starting my 100 days of code by going back through those challenges we were given and finishing them.

**Thoughts** Its funny to look back at how frustrated I was and how much easier the answers come to me now. I was able to quickly work through 4 of my unfinished problems on https://www.codewars.com/ within my hour of coding and tomorrow I will move on to the last 3 I left unfinished.
